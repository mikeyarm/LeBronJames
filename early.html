        <br>
        <p>LeBron James was born December 30th, 1984 in Akron, Ohio. Gloria Marie James gave birth to him when she was 16
            
            She raised LeBron by herself with help from her family
            
            Gloria and LeBron moved around a lot, and LeBron even lived with his coach’s family for a bit while Gloria worked hard to find a job and a permanent home for herself and LeBron. 
            
            He was a basketball prodigy from a young age 
            
            A locally known basketball prodigy since elementary school, James was named Ohio’s Mr. Basketball (high-school player of the year) three times while leading Akron’s St. Vincent–St. Mary High School to three Ohio state championships in his four years on the team. 
            
            He became a national media sensation in his junior year after appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated, where the magazine billed him as “The Chosen One.”
            
            James was the consensus national high-school player of the year in his senior season, and the Cleveland Cavaliers selected him with the first overall selection of the 2003 NBA draft.
